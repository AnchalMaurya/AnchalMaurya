## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Anchal Maurya**, a passionate **developer** who loves building interactive and meaningful applications. I enjoy working with **Java**, **React**, and **modern web technologies**, and Iâ€™m always curious about exploring new tools that make projects more efficient and engaging. Over time, Iâ€™ve worked on different kinds of projects like habit trackers, budget apps, dashboards, and weather apps, each one teaching me something new and **improving my problem-solving skills**. I believe in learning by building, and my repositories reflect my journey of growth as a developer. Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on **full-stack development** and sharpening my skills to create scalable and user-friendly solutions.
