# 👋 Hi, I’m Anchal Maurya  

I am a passionate **developer** who loves building interactive and meaningful applications. I enjoy working with **Java**, **React**, and **modern web technologies**, and I’m always curious about exploring new tools that make projects more efficient and engaging. Over time, I’ve worked on different kinds of projects like **habit trackers**, **budget apps**, **blogs apps**, and **weather apps**, each one teaching me something new and **improving my problem-solving skills**. I believe in learning by building, and my repositories reflect my journey of growth as a developer. Currently, I’m focusing on **full-stack development** and sharpening my skills to create scalable and user-friendly solutions.
